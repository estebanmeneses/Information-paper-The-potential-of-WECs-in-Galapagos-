## OSeMOSYS Galapagos Results

There are 4 scenarios, each one with and without diesel subsidies:

- **Reference Scenario (REF)**: Thermal energy continues to predominate, with no major investment in renewable energy. New renewable energy capacity is added gradually, reaching 50% of clean energy in the power sector by 2050.
- **Solar and Wind (S&W) scenario**: Heavy investment is made in solar and wind energy, reaching 75% of clean energy in the power sector by 2030 and 100% by 2040.
- **Wave Wind Solar (WWS) scenario**: Heavy investment is made in wave, wind, and solar energy to achieve 100% clean energy in the power sector by 2040, with 20MW of wave energy installed by 2050.
- **Wave Wind Solar and electric transport (WWSeT) scenario**: In addition to the WWS scenario, this scenario includes the expansion of electrical capacity due to the addition of electric transport in the islands.

  Note: All csv files resulting from the OSeMOSYS model are found in the **OSeMOSYS_Results** folder named according to the names of the scenarios.
